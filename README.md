# Beanify 
Hey there, thanks for stopping by and taking the time to read this! I created Beanify because I wanted a way to see my Spotify listening stats **all year long**, instead of just at the end of the year. 
This is my personal iOS project, that i built to solve that problem for myself... and hopefully it can help others explore their listening habits in a fun, personalized way too.

**Beanify** is an iOS app that lets you explore your Spotify listening habits in a personalized way. Track your top songs, artists, and genres, and see Wrapped style stats all year long.  

Built with **Swift**, **SwiftUI**, and the **Spotify API**, Beanify is designed to be clean, minimal, and fun to use.  

>  **Work in Progress:** This project is still something im continuing to develop and iterate on! All of my features and UI are actively being improved :D
